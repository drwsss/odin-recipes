    <h1>Memphis-Style Pork Ribs</h1>
    <img src="./ribs.jpg" alt="Tasty ribs">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are wet ribs, sticky with a succulent, spicy barbecue sauce, and there are dry 
        ribs, where the flavor is all in the dried mixture of herbs and spices, melded into 
        something greater than the sum of their parts by time, smoke and pork fat.</p>
    <p>This is what they do in Memphis, Tennessee, and it's why Memphis-style ribs are some 
        of the best in the world.</p>
    <p>What goes into a Memphis rib rub is up to you, but most recipes rely on paprika, 
        brown sugar, black pepper, cayenne, garlic and onion powder.</p>
    <p>All sorts of other ingredients find their way into everyone's "secret recipe," but 
        the most common are cumin, dry mustard, celery salt or celery seed, dried oregano 
        or rosemary, chili powder, ginger, allspice or even white pepper.</p>
    <p>Serious pit masters spend years perfecting the exact ratio of spices for their own 
        personal styles.</p>
    <p>Cooking these ribs is simple: Rub the spice mix all over the ribs and cook them 
        slowly over low heat until they're done. Sounds easy, right? It is, sorta.</p>
